            Hi everyone! Today I will be talking about the museums in Munich,
            some tips and my favorites. I have been living in Munich for 2 years
            now, and I had the chance to visit every single museum in the city.
            I hope you find this blog helpful!
          </p>

          <p>
            I would like to start with the bets tip you can have as a tourist,
            most of the museumsin Munich are only 1 euro on Sundays (not if they
            are not funded by the state)! Since almost every place is closed on
            Sundays, makes sense to visit the museums. Even though it it quite
            cheap and museums are one of the few options one has for something
            to do on a Sunday; museums are never really that crowded. So nothing
            should intimidate you. Also there is no need to buy your museum
            tickets beforehand. Here is the list of some museums that are a
            single euro on Sundays:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Alte Pinakothek</li>
            <li>Neue Pinakothek</li>
            <li>The Museum of Five Continents</li>
            <li>Bavarian National Museum</li>
            <li>The Egyptian Museum</li>
            <li>Glyptothek</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            From the list above, my two favorites are Pinakotheks. Alte
            Pinakothek is such a museum that itself is an art piece. Most of the
            items are from between 1500-1750. But it also has a small Modern Art
            gallery in which you can see important pieces from Klimt, Van Gogh
            and Monet. Right across the street from Alte Pinakothek, stands Neue
            Pinakothek. It is on of my favorite contemporary art museums I have
            ever been in. If you are into contemporary art, then a visit there
            is a must.
          </p>

          <p>
            Onto the museums that are not 1 Euro on Sundays; here is a list I
            named "worth your while" from most important to least (from my point
            of view, of course):
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Lenbachhaus</li>
            <li>Museum Brandhorst</li>
            <li>Haus Der Kunst</li>
            <li>Residenzmuseum</li>
            <li>BMW Museum</li>
            <li>Deutches Museum</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Lenbachhaus</h3>

          <p>
            Lenbachhaus is the one museum in Munich that will display the
            importance if Munich in art history the most. As a fan of Kandinsky,
            knowing the Blue Rider art movement began in this city made me happy
            always. In Lenbachhaus you can see beautiful pieces from the
            contributers and the starters of this movement, mainly Wassily
            Kandinsky und Franz Marc.
          </p>

          <h3>Museum Brandhorst</h3>

          <p>
            This museum with a uniqe exterior stand in the end of Türkenstraße,
            where my dorm room used to be. If you like pop-art, again this
            museum is a must. Biggest name I can remember that is represented in
            the museum is Andy Warhol. If you visit this museum, and are in the
            are, reward yourself with a cup of tea in Brown's Tea Bar or maybe
            with an ice-cream from BallaBeni which is right across the museum
            (their coconut flavor is simply amazing).
          </p>

          <h3>Haus der Kunst</h3>

          <p>
            One has to admire this museum. It neighbors the most beautiful parts
            of the English Garten and has an amazing exterior. In the heart of
            the city, this museum was commanded by Hitler to be an art museum
            that displayed "real art". It is told that he despised modern art,
            and wanted to this museum to showcase Realism pieces that he liked
            only. Today, the museum stands as a contemporary art museum. Which
            is one of the biggest middle fingers and reasons why I love this
            place. And we are not done yet! On every first Thursday of each
            month, the museum is free to visit and open till 10 p.m. Since the
            exhibitions change every once in a while, this comes very useful
            when you live in Munich.
          </p>

          <h3>Others</h3>

          <p>
            Residenz is a unique museum, it includes parts that were built by
            different Bavarian kings and princes. It tires me out after a while
            but for some good photography it is an amazing place. BMW museum is
            a very good visit for an enthusiast, and a nice one for people like
            me, who has no particular interest in cars. Although I must admit,
            the joy my partner had was very infectious. And Deutsches Museum is
            the science museum of Munich. Unlike NEMO (the science museum of
            Amsterdam), the demographic of the museum are highschool students
            instead of elementary. The museum is next to Isar, has a wonderful
            view. It closes on 5 p.m. And a small tip would be that, if you go
            there at 4 p.m. (an hour before the museum closes), then the
            enterance is free.
          </p>

          <h3>Dachau</h3>

          <p>
            Once you are in Munich, it is also a good idea to visit Dachau and
            witness the dark side of German history first-hand. The are is free
            to enter for anyone who wants to visit and pay their respects.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Alright folks, that is all I have to say about museums in Munich. If
            you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. See you next
            time!
