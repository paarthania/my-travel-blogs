            Cześć everyone! We recently finished our trip to Poland, now here I
            am to talk about it! First to give a general outline, our itinerary
            was something like this: Krakow -> Warsaw -> Auschwitz -> Salt
            Mines. Divided into 4 days of non-stop walking and exploring. Before
            I say anything else, this would be my biggest, most important tip:
            Book your Auschwitz visit at the same time you are booking your
            fligth to Krakow! If you want to visit there, pay respects, and
            understand what actually happened; planning beforehand helps a lot.
            Visiting without a tour guide is not advised from anyone for your
            first time. We did not plan early enough, but I will mention how we
            handled it anyways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alright, so now, let us take a step back. We arrived at Krakow in
            the afternoon and spent all 3 nights we had there. Warsaw was a
            single day trip (it takes 2.5 hours by train from Krakow to Warsaw),
            so that we did not have to change hotels for such a short stay. Our
            hotel was located in Dietla District of Krakow, which is right next
            to Park Planty and all the attractions you will wish to visit in
            Krakow. Unlike Warsaw, Krakow is a condence city with everything you
            want to see packed together. Here is a list the list of attractions
            we visited in Krakow, spreading them across the time we had in there
            (please excuse the way I write these names, since I have an English
            keyboard only):
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Planty Park</li>
            <li>St. Florian’s Gate</li>
            <li>The Barbican</li>
            <li>Rynek Glowny (city center)</li>
            <li>St. Mary’s Basilica</li>
            <li>Cloth Hall</li>
            <li>Royal Wawel Castle</li>
            <li>Kazimierz</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Don't let the length of the list overwhelm you, almost all of them
            are side by side. In the first night we arrived, we also visited the
            Arcade Museum since we enjoy any and every type of video game, and
            had a very good time with the games. Now I will share the names of
            the places we drank coffee and ate, and were pleased. Since my
            partner cares greatly about the coffee he drinks, I generally spend
            more time on finding the greatest specialty coffee in every city we
            visit. Here are the places we enjoyed ourselves in Krakow:

              <i class="fa fa-utensils"></i> Old Town Restaurant and Wine Bar
              (for traditional Polish soup)
            </p>

            <p><i class="fa fa-utensils"></i> Mo-Ja Cafe (for breakfast)</p>
          </div>
          <br />

          <h3>Our time at Warsaw</h3>

          <p>
            In the following morning we visited Krakow, we caught the 08:40
            train to Warsaw. We prefered calling an Uber for rather long walking
            distances, since we had A LOT of walking to do ahead. After exiting
            at the central station, here was the itineary we followed to get a
            gest of the city, in order (unlike Krakow, we had to have an order
            to make everwhere before we returned to Krakow):
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The Palace of Culture & Science (right next to the central
              station)
            </li>
            <li>
              The Royal Palace and Warsaw Old Town (took an uber to upper most
              point)
            </li>
            <li>St. Anne's Church (walked our way down from there)</li>
            <li>The Presedential Palace</li>
            <li>The Tomb Of the Unknown Soldier</li>
            <li>Mermaid Statue (symbol of Warsaw)</li>
            <li>Vistulan Boulevards (next to Wisla)</li>
            <li>Warsaw University Library Roof Garden</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I enjoyed our time at Warsaw quite a lot. It is a spacious city and
            has a lot to offer. Based on my personal observation, Polish people
            really like folkloric tales. Since both Krakow and Warsaw
            established their symbols depending on these tales. From what we
            read, mermaid got to be Warsaw's symbol, since she swore to guard
            and protect the city after fishermen from Warsaw rescue her from the
            hands of a tradesman who captured her to gain revenue from her. So
            you can see the mermaid, unlike anywhere else on the earth, with a
            sword and shield. Even though we had a single day we still had time
            for two coffee stops so that we could try out everything. We liked
            both so I will share both but one stop for coffee is definetely
            enough:
          </p>

          <h3>Visiting Auschwitz</h3>

          <p>
            1.5 weeks before our flight to Krakow, I began my search to attend
            tours that included both Auschwitz-Birkenau and then followed by the
            Salt Mine tour. No matter where I applied, I had an e-mail saying
            that there were no available places left. So we almost ended up
            booking a tour (transportation and ticket) without a tour. Since the
            ones included one was almost around 400 euros per person?! Please do
            not but these tours and provide that money to operators. Since the
            impossibility of getting a place first started to stop tour
            operators from buying all the English tickets in bulks and then
            selling for a higher price, so they only sell the tickets on-site
            now. There is an option to send them a mail and ask for a place but
            unless you are 30 people, it is not going to happen. We ended up
            mentioning this to the hotel we are staying in, and they provided an
            option to us. Including the tranportation and tickets to Auschwitz
            and Birkenau, we payed 65 euros per person. We had to leave around
            6:30 a.m. so we could make sure that by the time that we were there,
            they still had tickets. A guy named Alex picked me and my partner
            (and Micheal, hi Micheal!) up from our hotel and guided us through
            the whole process. It was worth every penny and perhaps even more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have been to Dachau before, but of course this experience was
            something else. Once you start thinking you can't hate the idea of
            'war' more, just pay a visit here. It was around 14:00 when we were
            back in our hotel. In the same day we visited the MOCAK (Museum of
            Contemporary Art) since I had the need to see at least something the
            humanity did good after our visit to Auschwitz and Birkenau. The
            museum is right next to the beloved hero Schindler's Factory.
          </p>

          <h3>The “Wieliczka” Salt Mine</h3>

          <p>
            The day we were returning back, we visited the Salt Mines. There are
            tours that take you to Auschwitz and then Salt Mines as I mentioned
            seperated our visits. Going as low as 135 metres below the ground,
            it was an experience to say the least. Our tour guide loved to joke
            around, and made the experience better. It is not possible to visit
            the mines without a tour. I would suggest an Individual Tour ticket,
            and you can buy the tickets from the slots given for your preferred
            language from their official website. We did that and took an Uber
            to the mines. The journey cost us 12 euros (almost 30 minutes by
            car). So in total the amount we spent was almost the half of every
            tour that was offered for the mines starting from Krakow. So again,
            I would highly suggest for this one for you to arrange on your own.
            There is nothing complicated like the enterance of Auschwitz.
          </p>

          <p>
            And then, off we went to Krakow Airport, to return our home. I hope
            this blog was useful for you, don't hesitate to reach out if you
            have any question. Until next time!
